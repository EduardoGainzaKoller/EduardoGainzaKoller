### Highlighted Projects

**N-Body Simulation** (C++)
A real-time physics simulation calculating gravitational interactions between celestial bodies using O(N^2) algorithms (some improves coming soon).

**VC_P5 Emotion Detector** (Python)
A computer vision project using Neural Networks to detect faces and classify emotions, applying dynamic filters based on the user's mood.

**IS2-Pendulum** (Java)
A precise physics simulator for pendulum motion analysis.
